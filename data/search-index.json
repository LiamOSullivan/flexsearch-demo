This data story examines housing in the capital through the housing and planning data available for the city. There are two things to keep in mind in terms of understanding housing: First, it is a complex issue that involves a number of factors and outcomes including housing supply and demand (including homelessness), existing stock and type (social/private/rental, vacancy), house and rental prices, mortgage arrears and negative equity, access to land,  access to credit, planning permissions, homelessness, unfinished estates, land supply and price. Second, making sense of the present situation requires placing it in historical context. It is possible to make the case that housing in Ireland has been in crisis since the early 1990s and the start of the Celtic Tiger. Consequently, we have structured this data story into three parts corresponding to the three phases of the crisis: Phase 1: 1993-2006 (the Celtic Tiger years); Phase 2: 2007-2012 (the crash); Phase 3: 2013-present (post-crash).",
